        <h1>
            Happiness
        </h1>
        <p>Have you ever seen your friend sharing little details about her day and that sparkle in her eyes made you smile?<br>
            Seeing your friend talking about pubg so excitingly that her excitement makes you excited you too even if you are noob and dumb in games?<br>
            Seeing your friend progressing and getting success in every field. Telling her how amazing she's doing. Seeing her growing and fighting against the odds.
            Seeing her taking stand for her in front of this tyrant society. <br>
            When she tells you, someone who was trying to damage her image, who was trying to let her down, to let her in self doubt, but she stood for herself and counterblew her rivals. <br>
            Happiness is hanging out with friends, laughing and chattering about random stuff. Happiness is what you feel when your friend shares random stuff and you want her to keep on speaking. You just want to gaze at her sparkling eyes and excited face. When you try to comfy them, to make them happy and they literally acknowledge your efforts. When love begets love, care begets care. Little efforts are cherished. Only your existence is a full moral and spiritual support for them. Your silence is understood. You find them at your back. You grow and let them grow. You both glow differently. <br>
